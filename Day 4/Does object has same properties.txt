How to compare two JSON have the same properties without order?
var obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age:5 };
var obj2 = { age:5, name: "Person 1" };

Code:
var obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age: 5 };
var obj2 = { age: 5, name: "Person 1" };

function hasSameProperties(object1, object2) {
    let obj1Keys = Object.keys(obj1);
    if (obj1Keys.every(key => obj2.hasOwnProperty(key))) {
        return true
    }
    return false
}
console.log(hasSameProperties(obj1, obj2))

Description:
In our solution we have created a function called hasSameProperties which will take two objects and copare their properties. Inside the function we have used Object.keys method which will give us a the properties of the obj1 in an array form. The function also has an every() method. We have also used.hasOwnProperty() method. The every() method will iterate through all the elements of the array we get in obj1Keys variable and it will store it in key variable an then the the hasOwnProperty method will check if the values in key match the properties present in obj2. If the properties match it will return true otherwise false.
